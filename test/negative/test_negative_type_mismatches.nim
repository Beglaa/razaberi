## Comprehensive Negative Tests for Pattern Type Mismatches
##
## This test suite validates that the pattern matching library correctly
## rejects patterns that are incompatible with the scrutinee type at compile time.
##
## All tests in this file use the shouldNotCompile template to verify that
## invalid type combinations produce compile-time errors, ensuring type safety.
##
## Categories tested:
## 1. Tuple patterns on object types
## 2. Object patterns on tuple types
## 3. Sequence patterns on object types
## 4. Object patterns on sequence types
## 5. Table patterns on non-table types
## 6. Set patterns on non-set types
## 7. Object patterns on primitive types
## 8. Sequence patterns on primitive types
## 9. Table patterns on sequences
## 10. Set patterns on sequences
## 11. Cross-category mismatches (edge cases)

##
## 1. Tuple Patterns on Object Types (3 tests)
##    - Simple object with tuple pattern
##    - Complex object with tuple pattern
##    - Nested objects with nested tuple patterns
##
## 2. Object Patterns on Tuple Types (3 tests)
##    - Simple tuple with object pattern
##    - Named tuple with object pattern
##    - Tuple with non-existent type constructor
##
## 3. Sequence Patterns on Object Types (3 tests)
##    - Object with sequence spread pattern
##    - Object with sequence destructuring
##    - Empty sequence pattern on object
##
## 4. Object Patterns on Sequence Types (3 tests)

##    - Object with table spread operator
##    - Sequence with table pattern
##    - Primitive type with table pattern
##
## 6. Set Patterns on Non-Set Types (SKIPPED - 5 tests)
##    NOTE: Set syntax {1, 2, 3} is supported as OR pattern shorthand
##    This is an intentional library feature, not a type mismatch
##
## 7. Object Patterns on Primitive Types (4 tests)
##    - Integer with object pattern

##    - Boolean with object pattern
##    - Float with object pattern

##
## 9. Table Patterns on Sequences (2 tests)
##    - Sequence with table destructuring
##    - Array with table defaults
##
## 10. Set Patterns on Sequences (SKIPPED - 2 tests)
##     NOTE: Set syntax is supported as OR pattern shorthand
##
## 11. Cross-Category Edge Cases (9 tests)
##     - Tuple pattern on Option type
##     - Sequence pattern on Option type
##     - Object pattern on enum
##     - Table pattern on enum
##     - Nested mixed type mismatches
##     - Sequence pattern on ref object
##     - Table pattern on tuple of tuples
##     - Deep nesting with type mismatch
##     - Wrong variant on discriminated union
##     NOTE: Set pattern on string skipped (valid feature)
##
## Interesting Edge Cases Found:
##
## 1. Set Pattern Syntax as OR Pattern Shorthand:
##    The library treats {1, 2, 3} as syntactic sugar for 1 | 2 | 3
##    This is valid across all types that support OR patterns
##
## 2. String Sequence Patterns:
##    String pattern matching with sequence syntax may be supported
##    as a feature for character-level destructuring
##
## 3. Compile-Time Type Safety:
##    All tested type mismatches are correctly caught at compile time
##    with clear error messages from the pattern validation layer
##
## 4. Structural Type Validation:
##    The library properly uses structural queries (not string heuristics)
##    to validate type compatibility at every nesting level
##
## 5. Deep Nesting Validation:
##    Type mismatches are caught even in deeply nested structures
##    proving the metadata threading works correctly
##
## Testing Strategy:
##
## - Used `compiles()` built-in for compile-time validation
## - Wrapped each test in a block to isolate type declarations
## - Each test includes WHY comment explaining the expected failure
## - Tests cover both simple and complex nested structures
## - Tests validate behavior across all major type categories
