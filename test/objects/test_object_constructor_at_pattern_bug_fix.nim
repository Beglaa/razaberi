# ============================================================================
# BUG FIX: Object Constructor @ Pattern Support Added
# ============================================================================
# 
# **BUG FIXED**: Object constructor @ patterns now work correctly
# **PREVIOUSLY FAILING**: "Unsupported subpattern in @: nnkObjConstr"
# **NOW WORKING**: Person(name: "Alice") @ p, Node(value: 10) @ node
# **LOCATION**: Added nnkObjConstr case in @ pattern processing at line 7109
#
# **IMPLEMENTATION**:
# - Added object constructor pattern matching with @ binding
# - Supports type checking with `scrutinee is TypeName`  
# - Supports field pattern matching (literals and variables)
# - Supports guard expressions with object @ patterns
# - Maintains zero runtime overhead design
#
# **PATTERNS NOW SUPPORTED**:
# - Simple object @: Person(name: "Alice") @ p
# - Field matching @: Person(name: "Bob", age: 25) @ p
# - Variable field @: Person(name: name) @ p  
# - Object @ with guards: Person(name: "Charlie") @ p and p.age > 30
# - Recursive object @: Node(value: 15) @ n
