# MIXED ENUM/INTEGER SET OPTIMIZATION BUG - SET PATTERN DETECTION
# ============================================================================
# BUG DESCRIPTION:
# The pattern matching library has faulty logic for detecting whether set patterns
# can use native Nim set optimizations. When a set pattern contains both integers
# and enum values, both isIntegerSet and isEnumSet become false, causing the
# optimization condition `isIntegerSet or isEnumSet` to fail.
#
# LOCATION: Lines 5065, 5069, and 5078 in pattern_matching.nim
# LOGIC BUG:
# - Line 5065: isEnumSet = false when integer found  
# - Line 5069: isIntegerSet = false when enum found
# - Line 5078: if allSetsCompatible and (isIntegerSet or isEnumSet)
# 
# IMPACT: Set patterns with mixed compatible types fall back to inefficient
#         O(n) OR chains instead of O(1) native set equality tests
# 
# This test should demonstrate suboptimal performance/behavior until the bug is fixed.

# WORKLOG ENTRY FOR BUG
# ============================================================================
# ## Mixed Enum/Integer Set Optimization Bug - Logic Error  
# **Timestamp:** 2025-08-26
# **Issue:** Set pattern optimization detection has faulty logic when encountering
#            mixed integer and enum values. Both isIntegerSet and isEnumSet become
#            false, causing the condition `isIntegerSet or isEnumSet` to fail.
# **Location:** Lines 5065, 5069, 5078 in pattern_matching.nim
# **Root Cause:** Mutual exclusion logic incorrectly assumes sets can't contain
#                 compatible mixed types, leading to performance degradation.
# **Impact:** Set patterns with mixed compatible types fall back to O(n) OR chains 
#             instead of O(1) native set equality, reducing performance.
# **Test File:** test_mixed_enum_integer_set_optimization_bug.nim
# **Status:** Discovered - needs logic fix to properly handle compatible mixed types
